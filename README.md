## Introduction
A platform that allows users create feedback forms to be embedded on their platforms
============================================
The Contributors would create basic pieces of information to ensure this product is a success.

## Project Background
* The online world is here and it is here to stay. Feedback is an essential part of a business as it can improve or mar ones' business or organization. 
We sometimes get something because of the feedback some people have given on a product, a website, school, hospitals, shops etc. Some reviews we get from people can most likely be spam or can be done in a way that can put the platform at risk, that is why we are introducing our product “Feedback_gen”.
This platform will allow users create feedback that is embedded on their organization platform.

## Product Overview
Feedback is not just limited an advice, a praise, or evaluation. Feedback is an information about how one is doing in effort to reach a goal. It can be written comments, electronic comments, meeting with individuals and suggestion from friends. It very important in our businesses, schools, hospitals, offices and our everyday life.

Every organization wants to know what their users/customers think of their product/platform, it is a lot of times a metric for eveluation and can help them adjust towards serving the users better. The problem however would be how to get these feedbacks to be embedded on the platform and that is why this product exist. Simple, time-saving and very effective. Get feedback form embedded to your platform easily.

## Collaboration
For TeamQuail members, follow the following steps to collaborate:
1. Visit the Repository to the Project on Github Website: "https://github.com/zuri-training/TeamQuailw2_Feedback_Gen.git" <br/>
2. Fork the repository: Click the "Fork" button on the upper right corner of the Repo page.* <br/>
3. Make a local clone: 
     Click on the "Code" button on the Repo page 
     Copy the URL for the forked Repo "https://github.com/zuri-training/TeamQuailw2_Feedback_Gen.git" 
     Create a Folder on your Local machine / Computer for the project Workspace <br/>
     Open Command prompt / Terminal in the same folder location <br/>
     In your Terminal, type: <br/>
        `git clone https://github.com/github_username/TeamQuailw2_Feedback_Gen.git`
4. Open terminal and set upstream branch: <br/>
    `git remote add upstream https://github.com/zuri-training/TeamQuailw2_Feedback_Gen.git`
5. Pull upstream to get up to date with the original repo:<br/>
    `git pull upstream main`
6. Create a new branch for the task you are working on :<br/>
    `git checkout -b branchName`<br/>
    *(Make sure your branchName is descriptive in context to the feature you are working on. Also be sure to check which branch you are on using `git status` before you begin working)*
7. When you're done with your task, do:<br/>
    `git add`<br/>
   - Commit your work with a message:<br/>
   `git commit -m "message"`
8. To avoid conflicts:<br/>
    `git pull upstream main`
9. Then push your branch:<br/>
    `git push origin branchName` - This creates the branch remotely and pushes to that branch on the Github
10. Go to Github and create a new pull request to the main branch. It will then be reviewed and merged into the master.
